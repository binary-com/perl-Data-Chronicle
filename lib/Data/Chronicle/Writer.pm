=head1 NAME

Data::Chronicle::Writer - Provides writing to an efficient data storage for volatile and time-based data

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains helper methods which can be used to store and retrieve information
on an efficient storage with below properties:

=over 4

=item B<Timeliness>

It is assumed that data to be stored are time-based meaning they change over time and the latest version is most important for us.

=item B<Efficient>

The module uses Redis cache to provide efficient data storage and retrieval.

=item B<Persistent>

In addition to caching every incoming data, it is also stored in PostgresSQL for future retrieval.

=item B<Transparent>

This modules hides all the details about distribution, caching, database structure and ... from developer. He only needs to call a method
to save data and another method to retrieve it. All the underlying complexities are handled by the module.

=head1 Example

 my $d = get_some_log_data();

 my $chronicle_w = Data::Chronicle::Writer->new(
    cache_writer => $writer,
    db_handle    => $dbh);

 my $chronicle_r = Data::Chronicle::Reader->new(
    cache_reader => $reader,
    db_handle    => $dbh);


 #store data into Chronicle - each time we call `set` it will also store
 #a copy of the data for historical data retrieval
 $chronicle_w->set("log_files", "syslog", $d);

 #retrieve latest data stored for syslog under log_files category
 my $dt = $chronicle_r->get("log_files", "syslog");

 #find historical data for `syslog` at given point in time
 my $some_old_data = $chronicle_r->get_for("log_files", "syslog", $epoch1);
