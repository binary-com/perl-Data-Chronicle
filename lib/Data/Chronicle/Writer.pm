=head1 NAME

Data::Chronicle::Writer - Provides writing to an efficient data storage for volatile and time-based data

=cut

## VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains helper methods which can be used to store and retrieve information
on an efficient storage with below properties:

=over 4

=item B<Timeliness>

It is assumed that data to be stored are time-based meaning they change over time and the latest version is most important for us.

=item B<Efficient>

The module uses Redis cache to provide efficient data storage and retrieval.

=item B<Persistent>

In addition to caching every incoming data, it is also stored in PostgreSQL for future retrieval.

=item B<Transparent>

This modules hides all the internal details including distribution, caching, and database structure from the developer. He only needs to call a method
to save data and another method to retrieve it. All the underlying complexities are handled by the module.

=head1 EXAMPLE

 my $d = get_some_log_data();

 my $chronicle_w = Data::Chronicle::Writer->new(
    cache_writer   => $writer,
    dbic           => $dbic,
    ttl            => 86400,
    publish_on_set => 1);

 my $chronicle_r = Data::Chronicle::Reader->new(
    cache_reader => $reader,
    dbic         => $dbic);


 #store data into Chronicle - each time we call `set` it will also store
 #a copy of the data for historical data retrieval
 $chronicle_w->set("log_files", "syslog", $d);

 #retrieve latest data stored for syslog under log_files category
 my $dt = $chronicle_r->get("log_files", "syslog");

 #find historical data for `syslog` at given point in time
 my $some_old_data = $chronicle_r->get_for("log_files", "syslog", $epoch1);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 cache_writer

cache_writer should be an instance of L<RedisDB>.

=cut

has 'cache_writer' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    default => undef,
);

=head2 dbic

dbic should be an instance of L<DBIx::Connector>.

=cut

has 'dbic' => (
    isa     => 'Maybe[DBIx::Connector]',
    is      => 'ro',
    default => undef,
);

=head2 ttl

If a TTL value is provided when constructing the instance, this will be used as the expiry time for the data.

Expiry time is not currently recorded in the PostgreSQL database backend - it is only used for the cache layer.

This represents the seconds until expiry, and default is C<undef>, meaning that keys will not expire.

=cut

has 'ttl' => (
    isa     => 'Maybe[Int]',
    is      => 'ro',
    default => undef,
);

=head2 publish_on_set

Will invoke

    $cache_writer->publish("$category::$name1", $value);

if set to true. This is useful, if to provide redis or postgres notificaitons on new data.

Default value: 0 (false)

=cut

has 'publish_on_set' => (
    isa     => 'Int',
    is      => 'ro',
    default => sub { 0 },
);

=head2 set

Example:

    $chronicle_writer->set("category1", "name1", $value1);

Store a piece of data "value1" under key "category1::name1" in Pg and Redis. Will
publish "category1::name1" in Redis if C<publish_on_set> is true.

=cut

sub set {
    my $self         = shift;
    my $category     = shift;
    my $name         = shift;
    my $value        = shift;
    my $rec_date     = shift;
    my $archive      = shift // 1;
    my $suppress_pub = shift // 0;
    my $ttl          = shift // $self->ttl;

    $self->mset([[$category, $name, $value]], $rec_date, $archive, $suppress_pub, $ttl);

    return 1;
}

=head2 mset

Example:

    $chronicle_writer->mset([["category1", "name1", $value1], ["category2, "name2", $value2], ...]);

Store a piece of data "value1" under key "category1::name1", "category2::name2", etc in Pg and Redis. Will
publish "category1::name1", "category2::name2", etc in Redis if C<publish_on_set> is true.
